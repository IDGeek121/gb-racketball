# Racketball

This is an GameBoy game that I created using [GBDK-2020](https://github.com/Zal0/gbdk-2020). This should play fine on any GameBoy emulator.

## Controls

Up/Down - Move

A - Start game

Select - Reset game

## Building

1. Set up a GBDK-2020 build environment.
1. Run `make.bat` (Windows) or `make` (Linux/MacOS).
    1. These scripts assume that your `$PATH` is set up correctly. Otherwise, you can edit these files to point directly to the compiler.
